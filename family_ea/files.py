"""Files that came with messages: photos of things, for the inventory.

The bytes live on disk under FILES_DIR, named by their SHA-256 (`ab/ab12….jpg`), so the
same scan sent twice is one file, nothing is ever rewritten, and any sync is «list the
hashes, fetch the missing ones». The database keeps one row per file (`attachments`)
pointing at the message it came with; that is the only link. A note or an item shows the
files of the message that created it and of every later message whose ops touched it
(the `applied` log), so no LLM op ever mentions a file. Nothing describes or indexes a
file: the item page shows its photos as thumbnails, and that is the whole feature (a
«Документи» tab over every file was built and removed on 2026-09-12: too much).
