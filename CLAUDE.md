# Family EA

Private family assistant in Telegram: two adults throw text and voice at the bot, it keeps
one shared state (items, events, todos, reminders, today boards), answers questions from it,
pushes a morning digest and sends reminders at the asked time. Deployed to Fly.io, SQLite on a volume, in real use since 2026-09-10.

`docs/spec-v3.md` is the original spec (Ukrainian). It was retired on 2026-09-10: read it
for the idea, not for what to build next. What to build next comes from real usage; the
list is in `docs/status.md` (see «Status» below).

**Start a session with `git log`, and when the question is behaviour, with a fresh copy of
production:** `pull` then `log` (see Commands).

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                                   # install (creates .venv)
uv run python -m family_ea                # run bot + web in one process
uv run python -m family_ea web            # the web alone on the local db, no bot; prints a login link
uv run python -m family_ea chat --as oleh --name Олег   # the pipeline as a REPL, no Telegram;
                                          #   `/photo path.jpg caption` sends a photo
make local                                # pull, then production becomes the local db + files (chat, web)
uv run python -m family_ea pull           # production db snapshot -> data/prod.db, files -> data/prod-files/
uv run python -m family_ea backup --db data/prod.db   # zip: db snapshot + files -> data/backups/
uv run python -m family_ea log --db data/prod.db --last 50   # messages + what the LLM did
uv run pytest                             # tests
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .
fly deploy --ha=false                     # deploy; never without --ha=false (see Production)
```

`make` lists the shortcuts: `make backup` (pull + zip), `make log` (pull + log, `LAST=`),
`make local` (pull + production becomes the local data), `make web` (the web alone, a login
link), `make test`, `make lint`, `make fmt`, `make deploy` (with `--ha=false` baked in).

`pull` needs `WEB_URL` and `WEB_SECRET` in `.env`; it signs a short-lived bearer token and
downloads `GET /backup.db`, a consistent online backup, WAL included, then `GET /files.json`
and every file not yet in `data/prod-files/` (content-addressed, so a mirror that only grows).

## Layout

```
family_ea/

  auth.py       signed tokens (HMAC under WEB_SECRET): a `link` from the bot becomes a

  pipeline.py   store (message, then its photo as an attachment) -> context -> LLM -> ops -> reply
  files.py      FileStore (bytes under FILES_DIR by SHA-256, `ab/ab12….jpg`, never rewritten),

  bot.py        python-telegram-bot handlers (/start /help /today /debug /facts /web, text,
                voice, photo), the 08:30 digest job, the per-minute reminder job, «Відкрити» (a

```

## Principles

- **LLM understands, code executes.** One structured-output call per incoming message
  returns `reply` plus item/event/todo/reminder/today ops. Everything else is deterministic
  code.
- **No notes.** «What happened», stories, contacts, prices are not stored anywhere. A
  `journal` (Нотатки: full-text entries by day, FTS search, a web tab, `notes.md` in the
  backup) lived from 2026-09-11 to 2026-09-12 and was removed as not needed in this
  iteration. The prompt says so (the bot answers, does not promise to write it down, points
  to the facts for the stable part). The production database still holds the `journal`
  table, its FTS index and triggers with the old rows: `_migrate()` leaves them alone and
  nothing creates or reads them; `log` still prints the old `journal` ops. If notes come
  back, start from that commit (`git log -S JournalOp`).
- **Events and todos are separate tables, not a `kind` column.** An event happens at a
  time or on a day and then passes (never overdue, only cancelled); a todo is done or
  dropped, can be overdue, and carries at most a deadline day (`due`), never a time of
  day: anything with a clock time is an event. (Until 2026-09-12 a todo was a
  «commitment» with `due_at` or a date window, and the LLM filed appointments there; the
  single day field is what keeps the two apart.) Different lifecycles, different data. The
  same goes for any new kind of thing (reminders): its own table, its own ops.
- **Items stay out of the default context.** They can be many; the LLM sees only what
  changed in the last two days plus the search hits for the incoming message, the rest is
  on the web. Which item a message is about, the LLM decides from
  those candidates (an update with an id, or a question in the reply); there is no
  matching code, and an ambiguous message must change nothing.
- **The «на сьогодні» board is free text per member, replaced whole.** One `today` op: the
  LLM returns the new text of one member's board, and only when the person addresses the
  board explicitly («на сьогодні: …», «додай у сьогодні …»); everything else stays a
  todo or an event. Code never parses the board: it is shown as kept (the web, the
  digest head, the viewer's own first) and versioned like facts. Nothing resets it;
  staleness is shown («оновлено вчора»), not acted on.
- **Original messages are never mutated.** `messages.raw_text` is append-only.
- **A file belongs to the message it came with.** A photo goes to the LLM as an image
  block before the context of that one call (`llm.Image`, `user_content()`); the caption
  is the message text. The bytes go to `FILES_DIR` (`files.FileStore`, content-addressed
  by SHA-256, written once, never changed) and a row to `attachments` with the
  `message_id`, before the LLM call, so a failed call loses nothing. That row is the only
  link: an item shows the files of the message that created it and of every
  message whose `applied` log names it (`files.files_for`); no LLM op mentions a file and
  nothing describes one. An item `update` that changes nothing is still `ok` in that log,
  so «ось ще фото коробки» (an update with the id and no fields) puts the photo under it. Photos are for the inventory: a «Фото» block of thumbnails on
  the item page, that is the whole feature. A «Документи» tab over every file, with an
  LLM description per photo (`photo` field, `attachments.description`), was built on
  2026-09-11 and removed on 2026-09-12 as too much; the column stays, unused. The prompt
  makes the record self-contained (the model never sees the photo again), and a photo
  without a clear caption changes nothing.
- `messages.chat_with` is the family member whose chat the row belongs to, so bot replies
  and pushes can be attributed in context; `messages.llm_result` holds
  `{model, usage, request_id, output, applied}`, not the bare LLM output.
- **The web writes about a todo only through the db methods the LLM ops use**, no
  parallel logic. Three things: done (a tap on «☐» on the home page, a few seconds to
  take it back, then `POST /todos/:id/done`, `db.close_todo`; the done/drop
  buttons of 2026-09-10 were removed as ugly, dropping stays with the LLM), the text («✎»
  on the row, `POST /todos/:id/text`, `db.update_todo`, open ones only)
  and the order of the undated ones (`position`, dragged on the home page,
  `db.reorder_todos`); the LLM never sets the order, and `open_todos()`
  returns it so the timeline, the digest and the LLM context agree. Unplaced ones (new
  since the last drag) come first, newest first. Nothing reopens a closed todo.
- **Every push is deterministic and stored.** The morning digest renders each member's
  board (own first), today's and tomorrow's events, then todos due today and overdue,
  never the undated ones (they are on the web), no LLM call, and is silent when empty;
  `/today` is the same digest now. A reminder is text the LLM wrote at request time,
  sent by a per-minute job when `at` comes, to the one member it is for or to everyone.
  Both are stored as bot messages in each recipient's chat so replies to them have
  context. Anything else the bot sends on its own must follow the same two rules.
- **Web identity comes from the bot.** No passwords: `/web` (and «Відкрити» under the digest
  and `/today`) sends a member a signed link, opening it sets a year-long signed cookie.
  Whoever is in `members` can log in; nothing is stored, so removing a member or
  rotating `WEB_SECRET` is the only revocation.
- The bot must not promise what the code cannot do. The prompt lists what the bot does
  (digest, reminders, the web link); when a capability is added or removed, that list changes in
  the same commit.
- Keep it small. Two people use this; a feature earns its place by removing a real pain.

## Production

- Fly app `family-ea`, https://family-ea.fly.dev, one `shared-cpu-1x` machine in `fra`,
  volume `data` at `/data`, database `/data/family.db`, files under `/data/files`
  (`FILES_DIR` in `fly.toml`; locally next to the database, `data/files`). Fly keeps daily
  volume snapshots for 5 days; `pull` mirrors the files to the laptop.
- **Always `fly deploy --ha=false`.** Two machines would mean two pollers on one bot token
  and two SQLite files.
- Secrets on Fly: `ADMIN_USER_ID`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `WEB_SECRET`, `WEB_URL`. The rest is in `fly.toml`.
- A deploy ships code only. Tables are created at start (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`);
  anything else goes into `Database._migrate()`, idempotent steps that run at every start
  (the one there copies `commitments` into `todos`, 2026-09-12; the `memories` → `journal`
  one of 2026-09-11 went with the notes).
- Local `data/family.db` and production are separate databases; nothing syncs up.
  `make local` copies production down (db and files) so `web` and `chat` run on real data:
  that is how a web change is reviewed in a browser before it ships. To look at
  production: `pull`, then `log --db data/prod.db` or `sqlite3 data/prod.db`. Fix production
  data through the bot itself where possible (tell it what changed), not with SQL.
  `fly ssh sftp get` copies the main file but not the `-wal` file with the latest writes;
  that is why `/backup.db` exists.
- Never run a local `serve` with the production bot token while Fly is up: Telegram answers
  409 on getUpdates. Locally use `chat`, or a separate dev bot token.

## Status

`docs/status.md` (Ukrainian) is the living description of the system: «Що вміє» (what it
does, by surface), «Ідеї та туду» (the backlog, found in real use) and «Зміни» (dated
releases, newest first). A commit that changes behaviour updates it in the same commit:
the capability text, the backlog item it closes, a line under «Зміни». «Що вміє» is
written for the people who use the bot: a page or a command name at most, no internals.
The backlog may name code.

## Conventions

- Code, comments, commit messages: English. Bot replies, prompts, UI copy: Ukrainian.
- Timezone `Europe/Kyiv` for everything user-facing; store ISO UTC in SQLite.
- Secrets and personal data (`.env`, `data/`) are gitignored. This repo is public. Never
  commit tokens, Telegram ids, real names, or real conversation data, including in docs,
  prompts, tests, fixtures and this file. Every name in the repo is a fictional placeholder
  (Олег, Анна, Оля, пані Марія, газовик Петро); keep it that way. Grep for real names
  before every push.
- Three kinds of knowledge, three owners: `members` table (who talks to the bot, the
  Telegram allowlist; only `ADMIN_USER_ID` is env, the admin edits the rest on the web),
  `facts` (stable background about the family; the human edits it on the web, the LLM only
  reads it), items/events/todos/reminders/today boards (everything people tell the bot; the
  LLM writes them).
- Python 3.12, `uv` for deps, `ruff` for lint/format, `pytest` with `asyncio_mode=auto`.
- FastAPI modules must not use `from __future__ import annotations`: postponed `Annotated`
  dependencies referencing closure variables break dependency resolution (silent 422s).
- SQLite `LIKE`/`lower()` are ASCII-only; use the registered `ufold()` for Ukrainian text and
  `regexp()` (Python `re`) for word-prefix search. Search terms come from `context.stems()`,
  one heuristic (`word_pattern`) behind the events, todos and items search on the web and
  the item hits in the LLM context.
- Tests that check dates in the context monkeypatch `family_ea.db.utc_now_iso`; otherwise
  they drift with the calendar.

## Voice

Transcription goes through OpenAI `gpt-4o-transcribe` (`language=uk`) via a single httpx
multipart POST in `family_ea/transcribe.py`. That is the only OpenAI usage; the LLM is Claude.

## Claude API notes

- `anthropic` SDK 1.x. Structured output via `output_config.format` / `client.messages.parse()`,
  not tool_use tricks and not assistant prefill (prefill is rejected on current models).
- Model comes from `LLM_MODEL` env; default `claude-sonnet-5` at effort `medium`. Compare
  with `claude-haiku-4-5` once scenario tests exist.
- No thinking/`budget_tokens` config needed; use `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` if enabling.
- Op fields in `llm.py` are never `X | None`: nullable fields inflate the structured-output
  grammar and the API rejects the schema («compiled grammar is too large»; hit 2026-09-11
  when items were added). `''` / `0` mean «not given». Test a schema change with `chat`
  before deploying: the failure is a 400 on every message.
