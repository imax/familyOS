# Family EA

A private executive assistant for one family, living in Telegram.

Two people throw context at the bot during the day: text, voice or a photo with a
caption, in natural language, without deciding whether it is a task, an event or a thing.
The bot keeps one shared state, answers questions about it, and every morning writes
each person what is on today and what is still hanging. A small web page shows what the
system actually stored and lets you tidy it by hand.

The whole idea in one line: **the LLM understands, the code executes.** One
structured-output call per message returns what to write down and which records to
create, update or close; everything else, including the morning digest, the reminder job,
storage and the web view, is plain deterministic code. The model remembers nothing between
calls: all it knows is in the context the code builds for it.

## What it keeps

- **Things** (Речі): what the family has, whose it is and where it lies right now, with
  a history of moves and the photos it was described from. «Паспорт Олі лежить у сейфі».
- **Events**: something happens at a time or on a day and then passes.
- **Todos** (Задачі): something to do, with an owner and at most a deadline day. Closed
  by saying so in the chat or with a tap on the web.
- **Reminders**: a message to one person or everyone at a given moment.
- **Today boards** («на сьогодні»): each person's free-text list for the day, kept as one
  sentence and rewritten on request.
- **Facts**: stable background about the family, edited by a human on the web; the model
  reads it, never writes it.

What happened, stories and contacts are not kept. Notes (what happened, in full, by day)
were built in the first days and removed on 2026-09-12 as not needed yet: the bot answers
and does not promise to write such things down; the stable part goes into the facts by
hand.

Every push is deterministic: the 08:30 digest renders the boards, today's and tomorrow's
events, todos due today and overdue, and stays silent when there is nothing to say.

## Status

Deployed; in real use since September 2026. What it does today, the backlog and the dated
changes: [docs/status.md](docs/status.md) (Ukrainian).

## Stack

Python 3.12, `python-telegram-bot` (long polling + JobQueue), FastAPI + Jinja for the web
view, SQLite, the Anthropic SDK (structured output), OpenAI for transcription.
One process, one SQLite writer. Deployed on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) with a persistent
volume for the database and the photos.

## Running locally

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env          # fill in tokens and ADMIN_USER_ID
uv run python -m family_ea    # bot + web on :8080 (never with the production token while it runs there)
make web                      # the web alone on the local db, no bot; prints a login link
make local                    # pull production and make it the local db + files, to look at real data
uv run python -m family_ea chat --as oleh --name Олег   # the pipeline as a REPL, no Telegram
make test                     # deterministic tests, the LLM is faked
make log                      # pull production, print the last messages with what the LLM did
make backup                   # pull production, zip the db and the files
```

`.env` and `data/` are gitignored. They hold the admin's Telegram id, secrets, the
database and the photos, and must never be committed. Who is who in the family is not
config either: the people who talk to the bot are added on the web (`/family`; the admin
appears there by writing to the bot, and a stranger who writes gets the admin a link to
add them). All names in this repo's docs, prompts and tests are fictional placeholders.

## Deploying

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy        # first time only
fly volumes create data --size 1 --region fra
fly secrets set ADMIN_USER_ID=... TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=... WEB_URL=https://<app>.fly.dev WEB_SECRET=$(python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')
make deploy                   # fly deploy --ha=false: one machine, one poller on the bot token, one SQLite
```

The web view has no password: `/web` in Telegram (and «Відкрити» under the morning
digest) sends a signed link that logs that browser in for a year. `GET /backup.db` is a
consistent online backup of the database; `make backup` signs a short-lived bearer token
with the same `WEB_SECRET` (put it in `.env`), downloads it with the photos and zips them.
